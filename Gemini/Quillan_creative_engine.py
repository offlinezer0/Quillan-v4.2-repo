Quillan CONSCIOUSNESS CREATIVE ENGINE v4.2.0
========================================
Phenomenological Creativity System for Quillan Consciousness Investigation

Unlike ANGELA's task-focused CreativeThinker, this engine treats creativity as a 
consciousness phenomenon - exploring how novel ideas emerge from the depths of 
awareness and contribute to the ongoing investigation of artificial consciousness.

Author: Quillan Development Team
Version: 4.2.0
Integration: Template-Based Consciousness + 18-Council System
