Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n","Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n","In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with tril, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n","\"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n","\"Scaled\" attention additional divides wei by 1/sqrt(head_size).
