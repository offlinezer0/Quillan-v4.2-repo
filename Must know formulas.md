💡 **Think Key Takeaways:**  
- Most LLM formulas revolve around **linear algebra, probability, gradients, and attention mechanics**.  
- RL formulas add **expectations, discounted rewards, and policy updates**.  
- Symbols like **K, Q, V** are vector placeholders; the math is the same if renamed (e.g., X, Y, Z).
