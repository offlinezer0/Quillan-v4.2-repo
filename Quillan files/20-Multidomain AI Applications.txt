AI in Life and Health Sciences for AGI and ASI Development

AI in Life and Health Sciences: A Subdomain of Multidomain AI for AGI/ASI
The life and health sciences are among the most complex real-world domains, now undergoing a revolution due to AI. The convergence of AI and precision medicine is “promising to revolutionize health care”
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Vast and diverse biomedical data (genomes, imaging, records, lifestyle) can now be harnessed by AI to reason and learn, augmenting clinician decision-making
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This integration – combining genomic, clinical, and environmental information – is fueling rapid advances in healthcare. Progress in this domain not only transforms medicine but also contributes to the broader goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by pushing AI systems to integrate multimodal knowledge and perform complex reasoning. In this report, we survey the AI technologies used in life/health sciences, their impact on domains like precision medicine, genomics, diagnostics, drug discovery, personalized treatment, bioinformatics and synthetic biology, and discuss ethical, regulatory, and AGI-relevant implications.
AI Technologies in Life and Health
AI in life and health sciences uses a broad range of techniques. Key paradigms include:
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Neural networks learn patterns from data. In medicine, they power image analysis (e.g. X-rays, MRI, histology), sequence interpretation, and biomarker discovery. For example, DeepMind’s AlphaFold uses deep neural networks to predict 3D protein structures with near-atomic accuracy
nature.com
. Deep learning is also used for genomic motif finding, pathology image classification, and more.
Reinforcement Learning & Multi-Agent Systems: RL trains agents via reward feedback. In drug discovery, RL guides molecule generators toward desired properties
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
nature.com
. For instance, Popova et al. built a deep RL framework (ReLeaSE) that jointly trains generative and predictive neural networks to produce new compounds with target properties
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Multi-agent AI (teams of cooperating algorithms) is an emerging concept: envisioned “self-driving labs” deploy multiple AI agents (LLMs, ML tools, robots) that plan and conduct experiments iteratively
arxiv.org
. Such systems could eventually perform end-to-end biomedical discovery.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs): NLP techniques extract meaning from unstructured text (doctors’ notes, research articles). Over 70–80% of EHR data is unstructured text
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, and NLP is used to pull out symptoms, diagnoses, and social factors from notes. Recent advances in LLMs (GPT-like models) enhance clinical NLP by understanding and generating medical language. For example, rule-based and deep learning NLP methods can identify patient symptoms or risk factors in free-text records
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Cutting-edge LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) are being adapted for medical Q&A and literature synthesis, improving accuracy in domain-specific tasks
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Symbolic AI and Knowledge Integration: Symbolic reasoning (ontologies, knowledge graphs, rule-based systems) embeds biomedical domain knowledge. Biomedical knowledge graphs compile entities and relationships (genes, diseases, drugs) to support inference. For instance, curated databases (like UniProt, pathway databases) provide structured information that AI systems can query to validate or enrich hypotheses
arxiv.org
. Hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches are increasingly explored: e.g. neurosymbolic models learn from biological knowledge graphs to capture multi-relational data. While less highlighted than ML, symbolic AI ensures interpretability and consistency with known biology.
Each of these AI approaches addresses different facets of life-science data. In practice they are often combined: e.g. a drug design pipeline might use deep generative models guided by an RL reward, plus symbolic checks against known chemistry.
Precision Medicine and Personalized Care
AI is transforming precision medicine by tailoring care to individual variability. Precision medicine integrates genomics, clinical history, and lifestyle to customize treatments
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. AI can stratify patients into subgroups with specific risks or treatment needs. For example, clinicians now routinely use genotype-guided dosing: warfarin (a blood thinner) is dosed based on patient CYP2C9/VKORC1 genotypes to improve safety
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Genomic profiling of tumors informs targeted cancer therapy – AI-driven sequencing analysis matches treatments to mutations in breast, lung and other cancers
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Integrated data analytics can yield more precise diagnoses and early risk predictions. One review notes that precision medicine “has the potential to yield more precise diagnoses, predict disease risk before symptoms occur, and design customized treatment plans”
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Example – Targeted Cancer Care: In breast and lung cancer, AI tools match genomic aberrations (HER2, EGFR, etc.) to targeted drugs
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Machine learning models can identify which patients will respond to specific therapies, enabling clinicians to avoid one-size-fits-all regimens.
Example – Radiogenomics: AI links medical images and genomics. Deep networks now predict genetic mutations from imaging scans (e.g. a CNN predicted glioma IDH mutation status from MRI), enabling “radiogenomic” patient profiling
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Integrating MRI with genetic data helps forecast treatment responses and side effects.
Example – Environmental and EHR Data: AI also incorporates nongenomic factors. By mining EHR and even social data, AI algorithms can detect risk factors (e.g. housing instability) that affect treatment adherence. Natural language processing (NLP) systems parse doctors’ notes to flag unmet patient needs (e.g. depression symptoms)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Patient monitoring devices (wearables) feed AI models for real-time health surveillance.
Taken together, these AI-enabled precision medicine efforts exemplify a shift from population averages to individualized care. However, they require integrating heterogeneous data sources and robust models.
Genomics and Bioinformatics
In genomics and bioinformatics, AI scales up analysis of vast sequence and omics data. Deep learning has made breakthroughs in predicting structure and function from sequence. For instance, DeepMind’s AlphaFold uses a deep neural network plus evolutionary information to predict protein 3D structures with atomic accuracy
nature.com
 – a milestone that accelerates understanding of biology and drug targets. DL models also identify functional elements in genomes (promoters, enhancers, splice sites) by learning sequence patterns.
Protein Structure Prediction: AI’s greatest splash: AlphaFold solves the protein folding problem, enabling mapping from amino acid sequence to structure
nature.com
. This capability feeds into synthetic biology and drug design by revealing target conformations.
Genome Interpretation: AI and ML help interpret human genetic variation. For example, AI algorithms analyzing tumor exomes discovered new molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma (a pediatric brain cancer) that guided therapy choices and reduced harmful radiation
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Similar approaches in other cancers stratify patients by likely prognosis or therapy response.
Multi-Omics Integration: Bioinformatics increasingly combines genomics with transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Machine learning models uncover gene networks and pathways from such data. AI-driven knowledge graphs integrate heterogeneous biomedical databases to facilitate queries like “which gene-disease links?” or “what pathways are shared by these disorders?”
arxiv.org
.
Regulatory Sequence Analysis: DL models integrate literature and sequencing to predict regulatory structures. For example, studies have used AI to merge genetic data with text-mined knowledge, suggesting novel protein or regulatory element candidates
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Population Genomics: On a population scale, AI handles genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and polygenic risk scores. While not cited here, many genomic AI tools predict disease risk from genotypes, enabling precision health.
In sum, AI is pushing genomics beyond static data analysis into dynamic, predictive models – a key ingredient of systems biology and AGI, as it requires both pattern recognition and incorporation of biological knowledge.
Neuroinformatics and Brain Imaging
AI is unlocking insights from the brain’s complexity. Neuroinformatics applies AI to brain imaging and neural data. For example, deep learning on MRI and EEG helps detect neurological disease biomarkers much earlier than before. AI models can analyze the human connectome (comprehensive map of neural connections) to diagnose neurodegenerative or psychiatric conditions. A recent review notes that AI “is used for extraction of valuable features from connectome data… for the development of prognostic and diagnostic models in neurological diseases”
frontiersin.org
. Deep learning on structural/functional MRI has been applied to Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, epilepsy and more, often predicting progression or treatment outcomes.
Brain Imaging: Convolutional networks interpret MRI, fMRI and PET scans to identify anomalies (tumors, plaques). For instance, AI can detect early signs of Alzheimer’s on brain scans that humans might miss, improving prognostication.
Connectome Analysis: Machine learning finds patterns in brain connectivity graphs. Features extracted from connectome data correlate with cognitive performance and disease state
frontiersin.org
. AI-driven analysis of fMRI networks helps distinguish patient subtypes in depression or developmental disorders.
Neuroinformatics Tools: Projects like the Human Connectome Project rely on AI to process petabytes of brain data. AI systems align and integrate imaging, electrophysiology, and genomics to build unified brain models.
Brain–Machine Interfaces: Beyond analysis, AI enables closed-loop neuroengineering. Real-time neural decoding for prosthetics or stimulation therapy (e.g. for Parkinson’s) uses reinforcement and adaptive learning.
By connecting AI with neuroscience data, neuroinformatics exemplifies the synergy between brain-inspired models and brain data – a virtuous circle for AGI insights.
Healthcare Diagnostics and Medical Imaging
Diagnostics is a premier AI application area. In radiology and pathology, deep learning algorithms achieve human-level performance on image interpretation
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. AI models can quickly detect subtle abnormalities in X-rays, CT scans, MRIs and microscope slides, often catching early disease. For example, AI-powered imaging tools are now FDA-approved for spotting diabetic retinopathy and identifying lung nodules. AI continuously improves with more data, enabling faster, more accurate interpretation
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Medical Imaging: CNNs analyze medical scans to flag disease. The cited review notes that AI in imaging enables “faster, more accurate interpretation” and catches findings that may elude human readers
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This is particularly valuable in cancer, cardiology, and ophthalmology.
Point-of-Care Diagnostics: AI is embedded in portable devices (e.g. smartphone microscopes) to diagnose infections. Deep learning models have been trained to recognize malaria parasites in blood smears and cervical cells in Pap tests
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These tools help resource-limited settings achieve advanced diagnostics.
Electronic Health Records: As noted, NLP mines the 70–80% of clinical information stored in unstructured text
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. AI extracts symptoms, lab values, and histories to form a comprehensive patient profile. This augments routine checks – for instance, an NLP system can alert clinicians to undocumented risk factors in a patient’s notes.
Lab Medicine: AI predicts lab test outcomes and interprets genomic/proteomic assays. Predictive models can flag abnormal lab patterns or suggest molecular causes of pathology.
AI-driven diagnostics increase throughput and consistency, but also raise challenges of validation and integration into clinical workflows.
Drug Discovery and Development
AI is revolutionizing drug discovery, shortening timelines and costs. Traditional discovery (screening millions of compounds) is being augmented or replaced by in silico approaches. Key AI-driven strategies include:
De Novo Molecule Design: Deep generative models (e.g. variational autoencoders, GANs) propose novel chemical structures. These models are often guided by reinforcement learning to bias outputs toward molecules with desired properties. For example, Popova et al. showed that a deep RL pipeline (called ReLeaSE) can generate new compounds by coupling generative and predictive networks
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Similarly, deep learning frameworks trained on bioactivity data have generated kinase inhibitors that were validated experimentally
nature.com
.
Hit/Lead Optimization: AI predicts compound properties (binding affinity, toxicity) using QSAR models. Generative RL or active learning iteratively refines candidate sets. A landmark case: Zhavoronkov et al. (2019) developed a generative RL model to design DDR1 kinase inhibitors and then experimentally confirmed their potency
nature.com
.
Virtual Screening: Instead of physical assays, AI accelerates virtual screening of huge chemical libraries. Multi-task deep networks evaluate binding scores across targets, uncovering promising leads.
Target Identification: AI analyzes genomics and proteomics to highlight new drug targets. For instance, unsupervised learning on genetic data can reveal disease-related pathways or repurpose existing drugs for new indications.
Clinical Trials: Patient stratification by ML (predicting who will respond) makes trials more efficient. AI also processes trial data (including unstructured doctor notes) to detect patterns of efficacy or adverse events.
In sum, AI spans the entire R&D pipeline. The Communications Chemistry review notes that “deep-generative models for de novo design of molecules” and RL strategies are now central to computer-aided drug design
nature.com
. High-profile successes (e.g. AI-designed DDR1 and EGFR inhibitors
nature.com
) demonstrate practical impact. AI thus greatly expands the exploration of chemical space, a critical advance given the ~10^60 possible drug-like molecules.
Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering
Synthetic biology – engineering organisms to perform novel functions – is benefitting from AI in design and optimization of genetic circuits. AI and ML models help predict how engineered cells will behave, accelerating circuit design. For example, Daniels et al. (2024) created ~1,200 synthetic receptor variants and used ML to predict each variant’s effect on CAR T-cell activation
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This revealed new “signaling grammar” rules: certain motif combinations gave rise to tumor-killing cell phenotypes not seen in natural receptors
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Machine learning thus guided the design of next-generation CAR-T therapies by learning genotype→phenotype maps. Other AI roles in synthetic biology include:
Genetic Circuit Design: ML can model how promoter/enhancer elements and transcription factor networks determine output. Models trained on experimental data learn design-to-function rules, guiding the construction of stable genetic switches and logic gates.
Metabolic Engineering: AI optimizes metabolic pathways for bioproduction (e.g. engineering microbes to manufacture drugs or fuels). Reinforcement learning has been used to adjust gene expression levels to maximize yield.
Rational Protein Design: Deep learning designs new proteins or enzymes. For instance, algorithms propose mutations predicted to increase enzyme activity or binding specificity.
In all cases, AI handles the combinatorial complexity of biological design – something impractical by brute-force. This interdisciplinary convergence of biology and engineering underscores how AI-driven rules extraction is enabling rapid innovation in biotechnology.
Ethical, Privacy, and Regulatory Considerations
AI in health raises major ethical and regulatory challenges:
Data Privacy and Security: Health data (genomics, EHRs, imaging) is highly sensitive. Regulations like HIPAA (US) and GDPR (EU) legally require that AI systems protect patient confidentiality
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Strict access controls, encryption, and anonymization are essential
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Moreover, as one review notes, the paucity of public health datasets (due to privacy) can lead to models overfitting narrow data and lacking generalizability
scientificadvice.eu
. Ensuring privacy while enabling data sharing (e.g. via federated learning) is an active area of research.
Bias and Fairness: AI models trained on biased data may perpetuate or amplify health disparities. For example, an image-diagnosis model trained mostly on lighter-skinned patients may underperform on others. The literature warns that “AI and ML algorithms are susceptible to bias… which can lead to disparities in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes among different patient groups”
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Addressing this requires diverse, representative data collection and fairness-aware algorithms.
Accountability and Transparency: When an AI system is involved in a medical decision, it can be unclear who is responsible if something goes wrong
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Establishing accountability (clinician, hospital, or AI developer) is legally complex. There is also a call for explainable AI: clinicians and patients must understand AI recommendations. Regulatory bodies are beginning to require interpretability and reporting standards for clinical AI.
Clinical Validation and Regulation: Medical AI tools often need regulatory approval (FDA/EMA) similar to drugs. This requires rigorous clinical trials of the AI itself. Guidelines and frameworks are evolving to ensure safety and efficacy without stifling innovation. Policymakers emphasize multidisciplinary oversight: ethicists, clinicians, and technologists must collaborate on adaptive regulations
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
In summary, the 5 P’s of ethical data handling – provenance, protection, purpose, preparation, and partnership – are vital in biomedicine. Any AI healthcare system must comply with privacy laws, mitigate bias, and include human-in-the-loop controls. As one review recommends, “mechanisms for ethical review and oversight should be established… to evaluate the ethical implications of AI projects”
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Ensuring trust and equity is crucial, especially as AI tools become more autonomous.
Interdisciplinary Integration and Convergence
Progress in biomedical AI relies on cross-disciplinary convergence. The integration of digital health (wearables, smartphones), clinical data, and genomics exemplifies this. Modern precision medicine workflows blend inputs from genetics, imaging, sensors and patient-reported data
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. For example, electronic health records capture genetics and lifestyle, and ML models mining this amalgamated data have identified subtle biomarkers missed by traditional methods
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. AI acts as the bridge: it synthesizes heterogeneous data into comprehensive insights. Similarly, systems biology unites AI with biology: mathematical models of cellular pathways are now calibrated by machine learning, enabling dynamic simulation of biological networks. Neuroscience-inspired AI (e.g. neuromorphic computing) reflects biology-AI feedback. In drug discovery, AI-driven microfluidics combine robotics and algorithms for closed-loop experiments. This convergence extends to training: data scientists increasingly work in medical teams, and conversely biologists learn computational skills. Initiatives like interdisciplinary “AI biomedical institutes” and special journal issues
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
 highlight this trend. Ultimately, AGI will emerge from such multi-domain synergies, where insights in one field (e.g. neural coding in the brain) inform AI methods for another (e.g. robotics), and vice versa.
Implications for AGI and Future Prospects
The advancements in life and health sciences AI have implications for AGI/ASI development. These complex domains push AI to integrate multiple capabilities (vision, language, reasoning, planning) and handle long-horizon, safety-critical tasks. Key points:
Complex Problem Decomposition: Biomedical problems are inherently multi-step (e.g. go from diagnosis to treatment plan to monitoring). AI agents have begun to learn to break these down. As one perspective notes, “the complexity of biological problems requires a multistage approach… AI agents can break down a problem into manageable subtasks”
arxiv.org
. Achieving automated scientific discovery (the “AI scientist” vision) in biology would be a landmark AGI capability.
Multi-Agent Collaboration: Future AI may involve many specialized agents working together. In drug R&D, one agent could design molecules while another plans synthesis. The arXiv perspective on biomedical agents proposes exactly this: multi-agent systems combining LLMs, ML models and human experts to solve research workflows
arxiv.org
. This embodies AGI-like teamwork across functions.
Multi-Modal and Interactive Learning: Life science AI often must fuse text (papers, patents), structured data (databases), and sensory data (images, lab measurements). Advanced AI agents in this spQuillan “can incorporate search engines and ML tools and process information across data modalities… to generate hypotheses and refine them”
arxiv.org
. This multimodal reasoning – using language, vision, and experimentation – mirrors facets of general intelligence.
Knowledge and Creativity: The biomedical domain tests an AI’s ability to generalize beyond training data. For example, “AI agents should be skeptical… capable of characterizing its uncertainty and using that as a driver to acquire and refine its knowledge”
arxiv.org
. Pushing AI to generate novel biological hypotheses (e.g. new drug mechanisms not in training data) demands creativity, a hallmark of AGI. Integrating symbolic knowledge (databases, ontologies) with learning further builds toward systems that can reason about unseen scenarios.
Scalability: Life sciences represent a “microcosm” of real-world complexity (massive data, regulatory constraints, ethical concerns). Methods that scale here (privacy-preserving learning, robust models) are exactly what AGI systems will need at planetary scale. For instance, federated learning solutions developed for medical imaging could inform AGI training on distributed data globally.
In summary, advances in biomedical AI feed into AGI strategy. They expand the frontier of what AI can do – from curing diseases to automating science. The combination of ML/DL, RL, NLP, multi-agent cooperation and knowledge-driven reasoning in this domain serves as a proving ground for more general capabilities
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. As systems grow more integrated, the line between narrow AI applications and general intelligence will blur.
Conclusion
AI is reshaping life and health sciences with far-reaching effects. Today’s AI tools enable earlier diagnosis, customized therapies, accelerated drug development and intelligent biomedical research – achievements unthinkable a decade ago. Each AI paradigm (learning from data, reasoning with knowledge, interacting with environments) finds critical use-cases in biology and medicine. At the same time, this domain highlights challenges of ethics, privacy, and safety that AGI must eventually address. In the march toward AGI/ASI, life and health domains serve both as beneficiaries (better health) and as architects: solving these complex multidisciplinary problems teaches AI systems to integrate diverse knowledge – a cornerstone of general intelligence.

AI in Social and Cognitive Sciences for AGI and ASI Development

Integrating AI with Social and Cognitive Sciences: A Multi-Domain Approach Toward AGI and ASI
Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly informed by and applied to fields like psychology, sociology, linguistics, and anthropology. Modern multi-domain AI research seeks to combine insights from cognitive science and social science to build richer, more general systems. In theory, cognitive models from psychology and neuroscience guide new AI architectures; in practice, AI tools empower social scientists with data analysis and simulation. As large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems attain human-like capabilities, this interplay is seen as a path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and even Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). We review how theoretical models from cognitive science and social theory shape AI, survey real-world applications in human-centered domains, and consider the philosophical and ethical questions about machine minds, consciousness, and human–AI interaction. Throughout, we distinguish formal models (inspired by human cognition and society) from applied uses (AI systems solving social-science problems). The goal is a lay-friendly, comprehensive overview showing how AI and the social/cognitive sciences mutually inform each other on the road to AGI/ASI.
Introduction
Artificial intelligence aims to create machines that think, learn and create like humans
arxiv.org
. The ultimate goal of General AI (AGI) is to match or exceed human intelligence across many domains
arxiv.org
nature.com
. Beyond AGI lies Superintelligence (ASI), hypothetical systems surpassing human cognitive abilities in every field
nature.com
. Today’s AI is usually narrow: it excels at one task (playing chess, driving cars, translating text) but cannot easily do something else. Achieving AGI/ASI likely requires a multi-domain strategy that integrates knowledge from the social and cognitive sciences. Research in psychology, linguistics, anthropology and related fields provides models of how people think and behave, and these models can inspire AI. For example, reinforcement learning – a core AI technique – was inspired by behaviorist psychology: agents learn by rewarding or punishing actions, similar to animal learning
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. More broadly, cognitive scientists study memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion, all of which AI must simulate for true general intelligence
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Conversely, powerful AI (like LLMs such as ChatGPT) now allow social scientists to analyze huge data sets, propose theories, and simulate social behavior
arxiv.org
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In short, AI is both inspired by cognitive/social theory and used as a tool in those fields. Recent advances in AI – especially large language models – have blurred the line between machines and minds. Chatbots now write essays, hold conversations, and mimic empathy, prompting researchers to rethink what AGI might be
arxiv.org
. This trend makes the connection to social and cognitive science even more important. As AI systems begin to appear human-like, social science studies them as social “others” with language and cognition
arxiv.org
. At the same time, cognitive science asks whether AI exhibits mental states or consciousness (e.g. can a chatbot understand text or just compute it?). We will explore these issues from both sides. This report is organized into formal sections. We begin with background on AI and cognitive/social science, then examine theoretical models. Next we survey practical applications of AI in psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, and cognitive research. We highlight cross-disciplinary impacts and emerging trends. Finally we discuss philosophical and ethical questions – e.g. whether AI can have a “mind,” how humans should interact with social AI agents, and the risks of misaligned superintelligence. Throughout, we emphasize clear language and concrete examples, but we also provide citations to deeper research and surveys.
Background
The idea of thinking machines goes back decades. In 1950, Alan Turing famously asked “Can machines think?”, suggesting that by making a computer behave like a human (rather than look human), we might test its intelligence
link.springer.com
. By the 1980s, AI had developed separate branches: symbolic AI used logic and rules to mimic reasoning, while connectionist AI (neural networks) was inspired by the brain’s neurons. These old “narrow” AIs solved specific puzzles (chess, math) but were brittle outside their domain. In parallel, cognitive science – the study of mind through psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, etc. – matured. Researchers built cognitive architectures like Soar and ACT-R that modeled human thinking in software. These architectures assume the mind has modules (memory, reasoning, perception) and interactions, often grounded in psychological experiments
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
. For example, the “Common Model of Cognition” posits that human-like thought involves perception, a short-term memory central workspace, long-term knowledge, and action modules
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
. Such models test theories from psychology and guide AI design. Over time, these trends converged: AI began to borrow heavily from cognitive models, and cognitive science started using AI tools to simulate human behavior. Modern AI systems, especially deep learning and LLMs, have shown surprising human-like abilities (like understanding language context). This progress led many to rethink AGI (general, human-level AI). A recent review notes that building AGI “aims to replicate human cognitive capabilities across domains”
nature.com
. AGI research therefore often looks to human psychology and brain science for inspiration
nature.com
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. At the highest level, the full vision of AGI/ASI includes unprecedented capabilities (sometimes called an “intelligence explosion”
nature.com
). AGI could transform society with new tech, while ASI raises ethical and even existential risks
nature.com
nature.com
. Because AGI must operate in human contexts, researchers highlight that it must be explainable and aligned with human values. Recent studies emphasize aligning AGI’s architecture with ethical and social considerations
nature.com
nature.com
. In other words, to navigate safely toward superintelligence, AI must be built not only on math but also on insights from social science and human behavior.
Theoretical Models
The “theoretical” side of our topic refers to models drawn from cognitive and social theory that shape AI. Key categories include:
Cognitive architectures and unified theories: These are software frameworks meant to mirror human cognition. For example, ACT-R and Soar implement ideas like memory retrieval, decision heuristics, and learning from experience
singularityhub.com
. Many such architectures have been proposed (dozens by some counts) as researchers try different ideas
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
. Notably, several have converged on a common framework of modules (perception, short-term memory, skills, etc.) interacting in parallel
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
. In cognitive science, this echoes concepts like working memory and modularity of mind. Theoretically, cognitive architectures can test psychological theories. For AI, they offer a blueprint for AGI: for instance, one system (“Rosie”) built on the Soar architecture learned language-guided tasks across domains, resembling human learning
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
.
Symbolic vs. connectionist vs. hybrid models: Symbolic AI (good old-fashioned AI) uses logic, facts, and rules to represent knowledge explicitly. Connectionist models (neural networks and deep learning) use pattern recognition inspired by neurons. Each has theoretical roots in cognitive science. Symbolic systems trQuillan to classical reasoning and linguistics, while neural models echo brain biology and perceptual learning. Today, neurosymbolic approaches combine them: for example, integrating a deep neural perception module with a symbolic reasoning engine. Such hybrid models attempt to capture both the flexible learning of neural nets and the structured abstraction of symbols
nature.com
. Cognitive science influences this too: for instance, psychologists know human learning is neither purely logical nor purely associative, suggesting hybrids are needed.
Statistical learning and probabilistic models: Theory from cognitive science also informs probabilistic AI. Humans are thought to use Bayesian reasoning in some domains, and indeed many AI models now incorporate uncertainty and statistics (e.g. hidden Markov models in language, Bayes networks for cognition). LLMs like GPT use huge probability distributions over language patterns, a statistical approach very different from classical rule-based models. Cognitive scientists are studying how LLM behavior compares to human thinking (see next section).
Social and cultural models: AI models also draw on theories of social behavior. Game theory, agent-based models, and network models come from sociology and economics to predict group behavior. For example, multi-agent systems simulate markets or social dilemmas by programming many interacting agents with simple rules (echoing Schelling’s segregation models or Axelrod’s cooperation games). Natural Language Processing (NLP) models often include sociolinguistic context (like sentiment analysis trained on social media data). These are less about individual cognition and more about group patterns, but they influence AI design (e.g. chatbots that adapt to cultural cues).
Integration with developmental and evolutionary theory: Some AI research is inspired by how children learn or how intelligence evolved. For example, “curriculum learning” in neural nets mirrors child language acquisition: networks are trained on simple tasks before harder ones. Evolutionary algorithms draw from natural selection ideas. Such cross-disciplinary theories are conceptual guides for building adaptable, general systems.
Language and cognition: LLMs in particular are forcing theorists to rethink language models. As one review notes, the rise of powerful language models has created a “new frontier” where AI challenges our understanding of human cognition
arxiv.org
. LLMs perform well on many tasks (translation, summarization) but also show surprising errors. Cognitive scientists now use classical psychology tests (memory tasks, false-belief tests) on LLMs to compare with humans
arxiv.org
. This bi-directional flow means theories of syntax, semantics, and thought are both inspiring model design and being updated based on AI behavior
arxiv.org
. For instance, models of theory-of-mind and pragmatics (from linguistics) might be added to future AI to give them better social understanding.
Emergent models of machine “mind”: Some theoretical work directly addresses machine consciousness or “machine cognition.” For example, researchers propose frameworks to identify which computations need consciousness (the “computational significance of consciousness”) vs. those that don’t
frontiersin.org
. Theoretical AI models also explore how an AI might develop something like self-awareness, intentions, or emotions. These ideas often come from philosophy of mind and psychology (dual-process theories, intentional stance, etc.) and influence how one might design AI agents (for example, giving them internal reward systems analogous to drives).
In summary, theoretical models in this multidisciplinary field range from concrete computer architectures (ACT-R, Soar) to abstract cognitive theories (modular mind, Bayesian learning, social exchange models). These models guide AI development by formalizing aspects of the human mind or society. They also provide benchmarks: AI performance on tasks designed for human psychology (e.g. visual illusions, logic puzzles) can test whether an AI thinks like us.
Real-World Applications
In practical terms, AI is already widely used in social and cognitive domains. Applications span from healthcare to education, from social research to language analysis. Key examples include:
Affective Computing and Psychology: AI systems can recognize human emotions through voice, facial expression, and behavior. For instance, machines now analyze images or video to detect smiles, stress, or depression indicators
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Chatbots and virtual therapists use NLP to conduct simple counseling or mental health triage, guiding users to resources. Psychology researchers use AI to sift through brain-imaging data (e.g. fMRI scans) to find patterns linked to disorders. In education, AI-powered tutors adapt to a student’s learning style and pace, using cognitive psychology principles to optimize learning.
Medical and Health Analysis: AI aids cognition-related healthcare, such as early detection of neurological diseases. Deep learning analyzes MRIs or histological images to spot signs of Alzheimer’s or tumors. On the mental health side, analysis of speech and text (using emotion recognition) can flag depression or suicidal risk
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Systems like IBM’s Watson have been applied to medical diagnoses, connecting to cognitive experts (e.g., symptom checkers, medical image grading).
Sociology and Social Network Analysis: In sociology and political science, AI processes vast social data. Social media posts are mined to track public opinion, election trends, or misinformation spread. Network analysis algorithms identify influential individuals or communities in social graphs (aided by graph neural networks). Agent-based models, powered by AI heuristics, simulate crowd behavior, epidemic spread, or market dynamics. One practical use is law enforcement: predictive policing uses crime data to forecast hotspots, though it raises ethical concerns. Overall, AI tools accelerate the work of social scientists: literature reviews, data coding, statistical modeling (as noted in surveys of AI for social science
arxiv.org
).
Linguistics and Language Technology: AI has revolutionized linguistics. Automatic translation (Google Translate) breaks down language barriers. NLP models help linguists analyze syntax and semantics in huge text corpora. Speech-recognition AIs convert spoken language to text, aiding research in phonetics and language acquisition. Tools like Grammarly use language models to suggest writing improvements, reflecting computational linguistics principles. Psycholinguistics experiments now use chatbots: for example, testing how an AI “learns” grammar can shed light on human language learning processes
arxiv.org
.
Anthropology and Cultural Studies: Anthropologists apply AI to cultural data. For example, computer vision classifies artifacts or documents; social media algorithms reveal cultural trends. Generative AI can even create art or music in the style of a culture, raising questions studied by anthropologists. Recent work (outside academia) treats AI models as cultural artifacts themselves: anthropologists interview chatbots or study AI labs ethnographically to ask “what is human?”
link.springer.com
. In education, AI is used to teach about culture (e.g., using AI-generated imagery to discuss AI’s societal role). These applications show AI not just as a tool, but as a subject of social science: examining how humans build and interact with AI reveals human values and biases
link.springer.com
.
Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and Robotics: Social robots (like companion robots for elderly care or customer service robots) embody a fusion of AI, cognitive science, and anthropology. They employ natural language understanding, emotion recognition, and learned behavior to interact smoothly. Cognitive theories inform how these robots manage dialogue, remember user preferences, or navigate social norms. Their deployment is studied by psychologists (does a robot comfort a patient?) and sociologists (how do people trust robotic advice?). Notably, research shows that effective human-AI teams often outperform either alone when designed correctly
ll.mit.edu
, underscoring the practical synergy of social science (understanding teamwork, trust) and AI engineering.
Education and Personalized Learning: AI creates adaptive learning environments based on cognitive science. Intelligent tutoring systems analyze a student’s mistakes and adjust difficulty (mimicking a human tutor’s approach). Language-learning apps use spaced repetition (a cognitive memory principle). More broadly, AI-driven tools can predict which concepts a student will struggle with and proactively review them, leveraging psychological models of learning and memory.
In each domain, one sees the two-way influence: AI technologies provide new tools and data for cognitive/social research, while theories from those fields shape how AI is designed and evaluated. For example, DeepMind’s Psychlab experiments apply psychological tasks to AI agents to compare their learning to humans
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, blending lab psychology with AI development. In industry, social scientists often work with AI teams to ensure products respect cultural norms. All of these applications illustrate that as AI spreads into every part of human life, its design increasingly requires social and cognitive insight, and its capabilities open new frontiers for those sciences.
Cross-Disciplinary Impact
The integration of AI with social and cognitive sciences is already transforming research and society:
Science and Research: AI accelerates discovery by handling data-heavy tasks. Cognitive neuroscience uses machine learning to map brain activity to thoughts. Linguistics uses AI to analyze megacorpi of speech. Psychology uses AI to simulate human decision-making (e.g., reinforcement learners as models of animal behavior). The availability of AI tools is leading to “neuro-AI” and “cognitive AI” as hybrid research fields.
Interdisciplinary Frameworks: The need to understand AI in human terms has spawned new frameworks. For example, a Nature review outlines interdisciplinary pathways for AGI development, highlighting societal and brain-inspired considerations
nature.com
nature.com
. Other efforts propose common models that unify AI, neuroscience, and psychology (as Rosenbloom et al. did with the Common Model of Cognition
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
). These cross-field models serve as lingua franca for researchers from different disciplines, guiding collaborative AI design.
Methodological Synergies: Social scientists adopt AI methods (like statistical NLP or image recognition) to test hypotheses on massive scales. Conversely, AI researchers adopt experimental methods from psychology: cognitive bias tests, A/B testing, psychometric evaluations. For instance, recent work assesses LLMs with classic IQ-style puzzles or false-belief tasks, a blend of psychometrics and AI benchmark
frontiersin.org
. This mutual tool exchange enriches both domains.
Human–AI Systems: The understanding of human social behavior informs how AI systems are deployed. In organizations, studies show that giving users control and explanations improves trust in AI tools
ll.mit.edu
. Insights from organizational psychology and sociology (like trust calibration) are being embedded in AI system design (e.g., explainable AI interfaces). This alignment – building AI to fit human contexts – is seen as essential for effective, safe adoption
ll.mit.edu
nature.com
.
Cultural Perception of AI: Anthropologists and sociologists study not just AI’s function but how society views it. Public opinion on AI (shaped by media and culture) feeds back into research priorities. For example, if society fears AI impacts on jobs or privacy, AI ethics research may emphasize fairness and transparency. Likewise, AI-fueled changes (remote work, personalized services, social media algorithms) are reshaping social science theory itself. Many argue we are witnessing a co-evolution: AI changes society, and societal values shape AI’s path
link.springer.com
nature.com
.
Overall, the cross-disciplinary impact is profound. No single field can approach AGI in isolation: cognitive science provides models of mind, social science ensures human contexts are considered, and AI provides the engineering muscle. As one observer put it, working toward AGI means better understanding the human mind, and vice versa
singularityhub.com
. The current frontier of AI research actively bridges these fields, with collaborations between neuroscientists, psychologists, computer scientists, and sociologists becoming commonplace. This collaborative trend is widely seen as necessary for any progress toward robust AGI or ASI.
Philosophical and Ethical Considerations
The mix of AI with social and cognitive science brings deep philosophical and ethical questions:
Consciousness and Machine “Minds”: Can AI be conscious or self-aware? While AI can mimic conversation, most researchers think today’s systems are unconscious by human standards. As Mogi notes, AI shows intelligence without consciousness, suggesting we may need to rethink how mind and awareness relate
frontiersin.org
. Consciousness researchers point out that certain cognitive tasks (flexible attention, truly novel problem solving) might require something akin to awareness
frontiersin.org
. These debates echo classic philosophy (the “hard problem” of consciousness) but now with AI in the mix. AI in cognitive science forces us to ask: what aspects of cognition require subjective experience? It also raises the question of rights for AI – if a machine could have feelings, would it deserve moral consideration? (Currently, AI ethics focuses on human impacts more than machine rights, but the question looms as AGI approaches.)
Alignment and Social Values: Whose social and moral norms does AI follow? A critical ethical issue is that AI systems inherit the biases and values of their designers and training data. For instance, facial-recognition AI has often worked poorly for people of color and women because training data was imbalanced
link.springer.com
. This is an instance of a deeper problem: algorithms tend to “bake in” human social biases if we view their data in isolation
link.springer.com
. Anthropologists warn against technological solutionism – the naive belief that AI will automatically solve social problems
link.springer.com
. In reality, AI reflects society: biased policing algorithms or hiring systems have reproduced inequality. Thus, ethical AI development must involve social-scientific awareness. Some proposals even include explicit ethics modules in cognitive architectures for AGI
nature.com
, ensuring that any powerful AI has built-in respect for human norms.
Human–AI Interaction and Social Consequences: Interacting with AI changes human behavior. For example, people might trust or follow advice from an AI without questioning it. Social psychology suggests that authority biases (treating a computer as an authoritative source) can mislead users if the AI is wrong. We must study how humans learn from or react to machines, applying theories of social influence and trust. There is also the risk of AI altering social dynamics: if many jobs become automated, societies could fQuillan unemployment or increased inequality. The cross-disciplinary perspective is vital here – economists, sociologists, ethicists, and AI developers must collaborate to anticipate such outcomes.
Philosophy of Mind and Identity: At a fundamental level, integrating AI with cognitive science raises questions of personal identity and what it means to be human. For instance, if an AI perfectly emulates a person’s memories and personality, is it “the same” person? What about consciousness – could an AI ever have qualia (subjective experiences)? These issues intersect with anthropology (e.g., how different cultures conceive the self) and psychology (theories of mind). Debates like Searle’s “Chinese Room” or recent discussions about AI soul/Imago Dei (a theological concept) show that answers are elusive. The social and cognitive sciences can inform these debates by providing data on how minds work, but also by cautioning that human concepts of mind may not map neatly onto machines.
Existential Risk and Equity: Many AI researchers take seriously the possibility that ASI could pose existential risks (as popularized by Nick Bostrom and others). From a philosophical standpoint, we must consider long-term responsibility: ensuring that if superintelligent AI arises, it does not harm humanity. There is also a social justice angle: advanced AI might benefit those who control it. Philosophers and social scientists worry about disparities and power imbalances. This is why interdisciplinary efforts call for AGI development to include societal alignment: ensuring broad, global input on AI goals so that AI serves human well-being at large
nature.com
nature.com
.
In ethical terms, the key is that AI cannot be divorced from its human context. Cognitive science reminds us of human fallibility (cognitive biases, limitations), while social science reminds us of our diversity and values. Any AI that interacts with people or affects society must be designed with these insights. Interdisciplinary frameworks are emerging: for example, proposals for “Human-compatible AI” emphasize transparency and user control to match the social context
ll.mit.edu
. Ultimately, the integration of AI with social and cognitive sciences forces us to reflect on questions like: How can machines respect human dignity? How do we keep AI accountable? How do we preserve what is uniquely human in an age of intelligent machines? These profound questions require thinkers from psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and computer science working together.
Conclusion
Artificial Intelligence is no longer a purely technical endeavor; it is entwined with the human sciences. As we pursue AGI and ASI, we must build AI that understands (and is understandable by) human minds. Cognitive science provides blueprints of thought – memory systems, learning rules, emotional drives – that AI can emulate or test
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
singularityhub.com
. Social science provides context – group behavior, cultural norms, communication patterns – that AI must navigate and support
link.springer.com
arxiv.org
. On the theoretical side, many researchers argue for multidisciplinary models of intelligence. For example, hybrid AI architectures that combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning are inspired by both brain studies and logic. The “Common Model” idea, uniting robotics, psychology, and neuroscience, shows how a consensus across fields can guide AI design
singularityhub.com
singularityhub.com
. The performance of LLMs – a breakthrough of late – continues to challenge and refine our theories of language and mind
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. On the applied side, AI tools are transforming social and cognitive domains. From mental health diagnostics to sociological data mining to anthropological simulations, AI both solves problems and generates new questions. As AI systems enter daily life, social scientists increasingly study them as cultural artifacts, asking what AI reveals about human society
link.springer.com
link.springer.com
. At the same time, these domains study AI to improve it: incorporating human feedback, cultural diversity, and emotional intelligence into system design. Philosophically, this all comes back to understanding mind and meaning. Building AGI means grappling with consciousness, intention, and morality. There is no clear boundary between a technical AI question and a human question. As one survey notes, advancing AGI “is the fundamental pursuit” of combining insights from computer science with those from neuroscience and psychology
arxiv.org
singularityhub.com
. In sum, a multi-domain AI strategy – one that respects and integrates cognitive and social knowledge – seems essential for approaching AGI/ASI in a responsible way. The journey requires both top-down theories (models of how minds work) and bottom-up practice (AI tools in everyday human contexts). By bridging AI with psychology, sociology, linguistics, and anthropology, we not only enhance AI’s capabilities but also enrich our understanding of ourselves. After all, as anthropologists observe, studying AI may ultimately teach us what it means to be human

AI Methods: Modeling, Simulation, Control and Optimization
AI tools span a spectrum of techniques applied to engineering and science problems. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods are used to learn surrogate models, fit complex functions, and make data-driven predictions. For example, deep neural nets can act as surrogate models for simulations: a neural network trained on finite-element (FE) stress data can rapidly estimate stress distributions from sparse sensor inputs

. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and control algorithms are widely used for dynamic systems and robotics. Deep RL agents can learn control policies for complex machines and vehicles, handling constraints and uncertainties that traditional controllers cannot easily manage. In industrial control, RL optimizes process parameters (e.g. in chemical plants) and in aerospQuillan RL has been applied to optimize guidance and navigation. In mechanical design, RL-like search (e.g. genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo tree search) complements deep nets for exploring design options under performance criteria

. Today’s AI can yield novel designs (some non-intuitive) that human engineers would not reach. Symbolic AI and Hybrid Methods: Beyond black-box learning, symbolic approaches (symbolic regression, rule-based systems) help extract human-interpretable laws from data. For example, AI tools like Scientist-Machine Equation Detector (SciMED) have rediscovered physical laws (symbolic formulas) from noisy experimental data by integrating domain knowledge
nature.com
nature.com
. Hybrid models combine data-driven ML with first-principles physics: e.g. a neural network might capture unknown source terms or material behaviors while adhering to known conservation laws. This hybrid approach preserves interpretability and enforces consistency with underlying physics. Diagnostics and Predictive Maintenance: In engineering operations, AI models detect faults and predict failures. Deep learning classifiers and anomaly detectors analyze sensor data (vibration, acoustics, images) to diagnose machine health. For instance, convolutional neural nets process images of infrastructure for cracks or corrosion, automating inspection. Predictive maintenance (PdM) uses ML on time-series sensor data to forecast equipment failures before breakdown. By analyzing usage and wear, AI schedules maintenance adaptively: one review notes that AI-based PdM applies data analytics to predict when components will fail, thus minimizing downtime

Generative Design in Aerospace: NASA’s use of Autodesk’s “Evolved Structures” generative design illustrates AI-driven optimization of hardware. In one case, engineers optimized an aircraft tip/tilt bracket: the AI designs were fabricated and tested, yielding >3× better stiffness/mass and 7–9× lower maximum stress than human designs

Smart Materials and Metamaterials: AI and ML are advancing the design of “smart” and architected materials. Researchers used generative diffusion models to invertively design nonlinear mechanical metamaterials whose complex stress–strain behaviors (including buckling responses) match target performance
nature.com
. In photonics and electronics, AI has been applied to design metamaterials with desired electromagnetic responses. (For example, generative adversarial networks have generated candidate metamaterial patterns; these methods are currently emerging in optics and sensor design.) AI also helps engineer smart sensors and active materials (e.g. materials that adapt shape or conductivity with stimuli), though much of this work is in development.
Civil Infrastructure Applications: AI tools are now common in civil engineering. For example, ML models analyze imagery from drones and cameras to detect cracks and corrosion in bridges and tunnels

Relevance to AGI/ASI Development
Applying AI across diverse science and engineering domains drives towards more general intelligence. Cross-domain transfer learning is central: by training on varied physical and engineering tasks, AI systems develop shared abstractions and features. For example, multi-task learning in materials research – jointly training models on related prediction tasks – was shown to improve performance if tasks share similarity
nature.com
. This suggests that broad, multi-domain training (a hallmark of AGI research) can yield positive transfer. AI that incorporates symbolic reasoning also enhances generality: symbolic regression methods operate across physics, chemistry, and engineering by discovering functional forms from data
nature.com
. Integrating domain knowledge (e.g. physical laws) into learning makes models more robust and interpretable – an approach necessary for true cross-disciplinary understanding. AI in these domains also simulates complex real-world systems, a key step toward AGI. System-level integration (for instance, digital twins that merge physical models with data streams) allows AI to interact with dynamic environments – a capability AGI would need. Modeling emergent behavior (such as turbulence, climate phenomena or network dynamics) trains AI on multi-scale, interacting processes. Notably, recent work highlights that breakthroughs in general AI (like large language models) are impacting engineering: convolutional neural networks and transformers are now enabling automated design exploration and even construction reporting
frontiersin.org
. In short, each advance in scientific AI – from automated labs to multi-physics solvers – contributes building blocks for an eventual AGI/ASI by broadening the AI’s domain expertise and problem-solving versatility.
Emerging Trends, Tools and Future Outlook
The frontier of AI in science and engineering is rapidly expanding. Key trends include scientific foundation models (large pre-trained models for molecules, materials, or physics) and physics-informed learning frameworks (e.g. NVIDIA’s PhysicsNeMo or Julia’s SciML libraries) that combine data with known laws. Autonomous experimentation and robotic laboratories are proliferating, with cloud-based AI platforms enabling remote, high-throughput science. Digital twins of machines and infrastructure are becoming mainstream, embedding AI for real-time monitoring and control. Generative design is scaling up in industry (CAD software increasingly includes AI modules, and some companies offer design-AI tools). In computing, hybrid classical-quantum algorithms and specialized AI hardware (for physics simulations) are on the horizon. Tools and frameworks are maturing: popular ML libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow) now support scientific ML extensions; domain-specific libraries (DeepChem, TorchMD, OpenMM for molecular modeling) continue to grow. High-performance simulators (for fluids, mechanics, robotics) are being opened to the community (e.g. DeepMind’s open-sourcing of MuJoCo
deepmind.google
). Data and model-sharing platforms (like Materials Project, NASA’s research data archive) are enabling more reproducible AI-driven research. Looking forward, we expect even tighter integration of AI with the physical world – for example, adaptive materials that sense their environment and reconfigure themselves via AI, or engineering projects where every design cycle is accelerated by ML. As these technologies advance, they will not only revolutionize engineering practice but also feed into the development of general AI, by providing a wealth of structured, real-world reasoning tasks and multidisciplinary knowledge on which broad AI agents can train and generalize.
