Deep Search Functions in Gemini and GPT AI Models

Study of Deep Search Functions in Advanced AI Models
Deep search in modern AI refers to enabling a language model to go beyond its static knowledge and actively retrieve, analyze, and synthesize information from external sources (like the web or specialized databases). Two leading examples are Google’s Gemini Deep Research and OpenAI’s GPT systems with search capabilities. Both systems treat a user query not as a simple one-shot question, but as a multi-step research task. In practice, they both break a query into subtasks, use web search or retrieval tools iteratively, and then combine (“synthesize”) the findings into a coherent answer or report. We examine Gemini’s and GPT’s approaches separately, focusing on how each handles planning, searching, reasoning, and reporting.
Gemini’s Deep Search Architecture and Functionality
Google’s Gemini (especially version 2.5 and beyond) includes a feature called Deep Research, an “agentic” system that autonomously conducts multi-step web research. Given a complex query, Gemini first plans a research strategy: it breaks the problem into smaller sub-questions and presents them as a step-by-step outline which the user can refine
gemini.google
blog.google
. Under the user’s approval, Gemini then executes this plan by repeatedly searching and browsing the web. At each step it uses Google Search and a built-in browser to fetch information, assesses what it learns, and may start new searches based on those findings
blog.google
gemini.google
. This creates a “search–browse–reason” loop where Gemini continuously refines its knowledge:
Iterative Searching: It uses Google’s search API to retrieve relevant pages and snippets. It reformulates queries and visits pages just like a human researcher (but much faster)
blog.google
openai.com
.
Continuous Reasoning: As Gemini gathers data, it reasons over the content in-context (using its large Transformer model). It keeps track of what it has learned, spotting new angles or missing pieces, and then issues follow-up searches as needed. The process repeats multiple times until enough information is collected
blog.google
.
Memory & Context: Crucially, Gemini uses an extremely large context window (about 1 million tokens) combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup. This means it can ingest and remember hundreds of pages of text during a session
gemini.google
. In simple terms, as it researches, everything it reads is stored in its “working memory,” so it doesn’t forget earlier findings. The RAG setup ensures it can retrieve relevant facts from this memory when synthesizing the answer
gemini.google
.
After gathering information, Gemini synthesizes a report. It automatically composes a structured multi-page answer, highlighting key findings with explanations and source links. The model “critically evaluates” the collected information: it identifies major themes, checks for inconsistencies, and even self-revises to improve clarity
gemini.google
. The result is a coherent report (often exportable to a Google Doc) with cited facts and the ability for the user to ask follow-up questions
blog.google
gemini.google
. Key components of Gemini’s deep search architecture include:
A planning model that splits queries into sub-tasks (multi-step planning)
gemini.google
.
A search/browsing agent that uses Google Search and a browser tool to fetch and parse web content
gemini.google
.
An asynchronous task manager that manages long-running searches without losing progress
gemini.google
. This lets Deep Research run for minutes and even recover from errors mid-task.
A synthesis engine that composes the final report from all gathered data
gemini.google
.
A massive context memory (≈1M tokens) + RAG, so the system “remembers” all information collected in the session
gemini.google
.
In practice, using Gemini Deep Research feels like supervising an assistant: you submit a query, approve the generated plan, and within minutes Gemini delivers an organized report with insights and hyperlinks. This leverages Google’s core strengths (web search and knowledge) combined with Gemini’s reasoning to save the user hours of manual research
blog.google
blog.google
.
Example scenario: A student asks Gemini Deep Research for “sensor trends in autonomous vehicles.” Gemini might break this into sub-questions (e.g. “What are the latest lidar sensor developments?”; “How do camera and radar technologies compare?”). It then searches for relevant articles, iteratively refines queries, and finally writes up a summary comparing the technologies, complete with source citations
blog.google
.
GPT’s Deep Search Mechanisms and Implementation
Unlike a single product, GPT refers to OpenAI’s family of models (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo/GPT-4o, etc.) that by themselves have static training data. To give GPT “deep search” abilities, OpenAI provides tools and modes that augment the base model:
Web Browsing Plugin: ChatGPT (GPT-4) can use a built-in web browser plugin. When enabled, the model issues web queries and fetches live results. Internally, this plugin uses Microsoft’s Bing Search API to get up-to-date content
openai.com
. The plugin is essentially a text-based browser (no clicking forms), and it respects site rules (robots.txt) for safety
openai.com
. As it browses, ChatGPT lists the visited URLs in its response. Crucially, the model cites these sources in its answers, giving transparency and traceability
openai.com
. This means GPT can answer questions about current events or niche topics by looking them up in real time.
Retrieval (RAG) Plugin: OpenAI also offers an open-source retrieval plugin. Users (or organizations) can host a document database (using common vector stores like Pinecone, Milvus, etc.) and index it with embeddings. When a ChatGPT conversation has this plugin, GPT can semantically “query” that custom database for relevant documents. The best-matching snippets are then inserted into GPT’s context before final answer generation
openai.com
openai.com
. In effect, GPT asks its own knowledge base for up-to-date or proprietary information. This is standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): the model augments its answer by retrieving and conditioning on external data
openai.com
openai.com
.
Deep Research Agent (ChatGPT Mode): In early 2025, OpenAI introduced a “Deep Research” mode inside ChatGPT, similar in spirit to Gemini’s. This uses a specialized GPT-4-based agent (called an o3 model) trained via reinforcement learning on tasks that involve browsing and Python tool use
openai.com
. When a user asks a complex research question, ChatGPT’s Deep Research agent autonomously plans a search strategy (like Gemini), browses the web, reads documents, and synthesizes a report. OpenAI notes it was “trained on real-world tasks requiring browser and Python tool use” and leverages the GPT’s reasoning skills to gather and combine data
openai.com
. The difference is mainly in branding and availability (Deep Research is a Pro-level feature that takes minutes to run).
Underlying Architecture: At the core, GPT-4/4o is a transformer model with fixed training data, so by itself it cannot know anything beyond its cutoff. All online search happens through these external plugins or agentic loops. The web-browsing plugin, for example, is conceptually inspired by OpenAI’s earlier research (“WebGPT”) on how a model might browse the web responsibly
openai.com
openai.com
. When active, GPT will generate search queries, receive page content, and reason about it. The RAG plugin uses embeddings (numerical text representations) to match and fetch relevant documents from a vector index, which are then fed into the model.
In simpler terms, GPT’s “deep search” is a tool-assisted approach: the base model calls external tools (browser, retrieval, code execution) to fetch current information. OpenAI emphasizes that plugins give GPT “eyes and ears” to access recent events or proprietary data
openai.com
. For example, GPT’s browsing plugin automatically cites where it got facts
openai.com
, helping users verify results. Meanwhile, the retrieval plugin uses embeddings to find the best answers in a user’s own files or knowledge base
openai.com
. Comparison of GPT tools:
Web Browsing (via Bing): Good for general queries on the open web. It’s fully managed by OpenAI/Microsoft, so users get up-to-date web snippets and citations
openai.com
openai.com
.
Retrieval Plugin (RAG): Good for specialized or private data. Organizations host their own vector DB; GPT searches it for the answer
openai.com
openai.com
. This bypasses GPT’s knowledge cutoff by surfacing relevant text.
Agentic Deep Research: Combines multiple steps. It plans queries, uses browsing and possibly code (Python tool) to gather and analyze data, then synthesizes the result
openai.com
. This mode is most comparable to Gemini’s feature.
Practically, these features allow GPT-based assistants to answer complex, dynamic questions. For instance, a user could ask ChatGPT (with browsing enabled) for “this week’s top news in AI”; the model would formulate a query, fetch news headlines via Bing, and summarize them with source links
openai.com
openai.com
. If the user is in a business, they might feed their internal documents to the retrieval plugin and ask GPT to “find the latest company project plan”, which the model locates and returns from the database
openai.com
. In all cases, the output is augmented by the actual retrieved text, and OpenAI’s design ensures the model cites its sources to maintain trust
openai.com
openai.com
.
Practical Comparison
Integration with Search: Gemini is natively integrated with Google Search and can continuously crawl the web in one session
blog.google
gemini.google
. GPT, by contrast, uses modular plugins (some user-enabled) to reach out to the web or databases
openai.com
openai.com
.
Context Length and Memory: Gemini’s context window (~1M tokens) is unusually large, letting it “remember” entire research sessions
gemini.google
. GPT’s context is smaller (in practice 32K tokens for GPT-4o), so long sessions rely on retrieving relevant context via RAG or running separate agent iterations.
Planning and Autonomy: Both systems plan multi-step searches. Gemini builds a plan for the user to review, then follows it autonomously
gemini.google
. GPT’s Deep Research agent similarly plans steps using chain-of-thought/RL techniques
openai.com
. However, typical GPT use (with basic browsing) is more reactive – it searches as it composes an answer, rather than upfront planning.
Citations and Transparency: Both cite sources, but in different ways. Gemini’s report includes links organized by section
blog.google
. ChatGPT’s browsing mode explicitly shows URLs and cites them
openai.com
. The retrieval plugin adds context but any citations must be handled by the prompt or follow-up, as the plugin itself just inserts text.
End-to-End Pipeline: Conceptually, Gemini’s Deep Research is a single pipeline built into one product, whereas GPT’s capabilities are provided via a combination of model modes and plugins (some beta or paid features). Both aim to bridge LLM reasoning with live data.
Summary
In summary, Gemini and GPT have converged on similar ideas for “deep search,” but with different architectures. Gemini’s Deep Research is a built-in, agentic research assistant tightly coupled with Google’s search infrastructure and a very large memory context
blog.google
gemini.google
. It autonomously plans tasks, uses Google Search tools, and reasons in a loop to produce multi-page reports with cited sources
gemini.google
blog.google
. GPT’s approach is more modular. The GPT base model relies on external tools: a web-browsing plugin (Bing-based) and a retrieval plugin (user-hosted knowledge base) to fetch data
openai.com
openai.com
. OpenAI also offers a specialized “deep research” agent that mimics Gemini’s behavior, trained with reinforcement learning on browsing tasks
openai.com
. Across all methods, the guiding principles are the same: use search or retrieval to get up-to-date information, then use the language model’s reasoning to interpret and report it, always citing the sources
openai.com
blog.google
. Both systems demonstrate a key trend in AI: blending search engines and LLMs into a cohesive agent. As one Google blog puts it, Gemini’s agentive AI “brings together the best of Gemini, Google Search, and web technologies to continuously search, browse, and think through information”
gemini.google
. OpenAI similarly emphasizes that plugins give GPT “eyes and ears” to the world, strengthening its answers with real evidence
openai.com
openai.com
. For users and future AGI systems, this means LLMs can not only answer questions from memory but actively seek out new information, making them far more capable and reliable as research assistants. Sources: The above summary is based on official Google Gemini and OpenAI documentation

Deep Search Functions in Grok 3 and Claude Sonnet 4

Grok 3 (xAI) – Deep Search Architecture and Retrieval
Two modes (Think vs DeepSearch): Grok 3 supports a fast “Think” mode (straightforward reasoning) and a special DeepSearch mode for heavy retrieval. DeepSearch is an agentic pipeline that breaks user queries into sub-questions, issues web and X (“Twitter”) searches, and synthesizes multi-step answers
techtarget.com
tryprofound.com
. DeepSearch “relentlessly seeks” up-to-date facts across the web and X, using chain-of-thought reasoning to cross-check sources and resolve conflicts
x.ai
tryprofound.com
.
Hybrid Web Index (Websearch): Underlying Grok’s retrieval is a hybrid search index. It combines traditional inverted indexes (for fast keyword lookup) with semantic vector embeddings (for conceptual search)
tryprofound.com
. Grok continuously crawls a broad set of sources (news sites, Wikipedia, social posts, etc.) to build this index, keeping it fresh (reports suggest ~14M pages updated in near-real time)
tryprofound.com
tryprofound.com
. When Grok needs information, it queries this index rather than live web crawling, yielding quick results. This two-tier approach (fast indexed search plus deep agentic crawling) lets Grok answer both simple and complex queries efficiently
tryprofound.com
tryprofound.com
.
DeepSearch Pipeline (Agentic RAG): If Websearch yields too little, DeepSearch kicks in. It decomposes queries into sub-questions, issues targeted searches, and even fetches full pages or X posts on demand
tryprofound.com
. For example, given “How are X users reacting to Grok 3’s launch?”, DeepSearch might search X and the web for “Grok 3 launch user feedback” and “Grok 3 review social media”, then crawl those pages to gather opinions
tryprofound.com
. At each step, it scores content for relevance and credibility, then synthesizes a summary with citations
tryprofound.com
tryprofound.com
. This resembles the ReAct framework: the model alternates between reasoning and tool use, making multiple tool calls (at least 3, up to 10 per query) to gather evidence
tryprofound.com
tryprofound.com
.
Built-in Tools: Grok 3’s DeepSearch has specialized tools (web search, page browsing, X-post search, etc.). For instance, a web_search tool queries the web; a browse_page tool fetches an exact URL; and x_search scans public X posts via keyword or embeddings
tryprofound.com
. These tools can be invoked iteratively to deepen the search. (The table below, from xAI documentation, summarizes Grok’s tool calls.)
tryprofound.com
【30†】 Table: Example tools Grok’s DeepSearch agent can call (image: xAI). Inputs include a query string or URL; outputs feed back into the model for further analysis.
tryprofound.com
Vector Search and Embeddings: Grok’s index uses vector embeddings under the hood. When we say “semantic search,” it means each document chunk (webpage text, post, etc.) was converted to an embedding. Grok retrieves by similarity in vector spQuillan as well as by keyword match
tryprofound.com
. In practice, user queries generate embeddings too, so the system can find conceptually relevant passages even if exact terms differ.
Context Window and Long Documents: Grok 3 has an extremely large context window (≈1,000,000 tokens)
x.ai
 – far larger than most models. This means Grok can ingest entire long documents or combine many retrieved snippets into a single prompt. In benchmarks (e.g. LOFT 128k tasks), Grok demonstrated state-of-the-art retrieval performance with this extended context
x.ai
. The huge window also lets Grok “chain of thought” through long reasoning tasks without losing context.
Memory/Caching: Grok’s system does not expose a separate long-term memory or cache for past chats (aside from what fits in the 1M-token window). Each DeepSearch run is stateless except for the current prompt. There is no user-facing “memory” that persists between sessions; instead, the model relies on its fixed web index (kept up-to-date continuously) as its knowledge base
tryprofound.com
tryprofound.com
.
Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic) – Deep Search and RAG
Hybrid Reasoning Modes: Claude 4 is also a hybrid model with two modes: a fast “instant” mode and an “extended thinking” mode for complex tasks
appypievibe.ai
. Extended thinking allows the model to call tools (web search, code execution, etc.) during its reasoning. Anthropic explicitly designed Claude to decide when to invoke tools like web search as part of its chain of thought
anthropic.com
docs.anthropic.com
. This gives Claude a kind of built-in retrieval loop: it can pause generation, fetch new information, and then continue reasoning with that information.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Claude does not include a fixed web index. Instead, retrieval comes via external tools or developer-provided data. The primary official mechanism is the Web Search tool: when enabled in the API, Claude can issue queries (e.g. to Google or another search API) and get results. The API then supplies those results back to Claude, which automatically cites them
docs.anthropic.com
docs.anthropic.com
. In practice, Claude determines when a query needs up-to-date info and invokes the search tool internally (potentially multiple times per prompt). For example, Claude can search news or blogs for current events, then integrate those findings into its answer
docs.anthropic.com
docs.anthropic.com
.
Vector Search / Dense Retrieval: Anthropic’s models do not provide a built-in vector database, but developers can implement classic RAG pipelines around Claude. This means users break their knowledge base into text chunks, embed them with an external embedding model (Anthropic suggests vendors like Voyage AI
docs.anthropic.com
), store vectors in a database (e.g. PostgreSQL+pgvector or Milvus), and query by similarity. Anthropic’s “Contextual Retrieval” research advises combining such embedding search with BM25 (keyword match) for best accuracy
anthropic.com
. In short, Claude relies on user-supplied embeddings and vector indexes for semantic search. Anthropic’s docs explicitly note they have no proprietary embedding model – clients should use external embeddings for RAG
docs.anthropic.com
.
Knowledge Bases and APIs: Through the Files API and MCP connectors, Claude can integrate with documents and tools. The Files API lets developers upload documents (PDFs, text corpora) that Claude can reference later
anthropic.com
. For example, a set of product manuals could be pre-loaded and then retrieved via embeddings in prompts. The MCP connector enables Claude to call any Model-Context-Protocol–compatible service (e.g. external web APIs, databases) as a tool
anthropic.com
. This means Claude can fetch data from business systems or custom knowledge sources at query time.
Prompt Caching and Memory: Claude 4 introduces session memory via prompt caching. Developers can mark parts of the prompt (e.g. background documents) as “cache” so that Claude reuses the encoded context on repeated calls
docs.anthropic.com
. By default, Claude caches for 5 minutes, but with extended caching this goes to 60 minutes
anthropic.com
anthropic.com
. This lets long documents or chat histories persist in memory without reprocessing, dramatically cutting latency and cost. For instance, uploading a full book or chat logs once and then querying it multiple times becomes practical. Additionally, when given access to local files, Claude can create “memory files”: it will write facts it learns to disk, then recall them in later tasks
anthropic.com
. This file-based memory helps Claude maintain task-specific context over long workflows (e.g. remembering a game state).
Context Window and Long-Form: Claude Sonnet 4 supports up to a 200,000-token context window
anthropic.com
, much larger than typical LLMs. This allows feeding large documents or lengthy histories into a single prompt. Coupled with extended thinking and chaining tools, Claude can perform long-form reasoning. For example, a single Sonnet-4 call can output up to 64k tokens (useful for rich code or report generation)
anthropic.com
. Unlike Grok’s 1M tokens, Claude’s 200K limit still covers substantial content, making it well-suited to summarizing big knowledge bases
anthropic.com
.
Design Philosophy: Claude is primarily a language model that uses RAG, not a specialized search engine. It trusts external systems (APIs, databases) for up-to-date facts and uses them via tools. Anthropic’s approach emphasizes safe reasoning and controllability: the model carefully decides when to call tools, and it manages retrieved information in its response. The emphasis is on letting developers hook Claude into any knowledge base or service (cloud data, company wiki, etc.) rather than giving Claude a built-in crawler or index.
